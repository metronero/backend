# Metronero Backend

Backend and API server for Metronero.

Metronero is a checkout system for Monero cryptocurrency. It allows merchants to generate payment pages upon checkout. Instances have the ability to house multiple merchant accounts and be monetized with commission.

For instructions on how to deploy and use the API, see the [documentation](https://moneropay.eu/metronero/).

# Donate
Although Metronero has garnered community support, [it was abandoned and left without consensus](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/ccs-proposals/-/merge_requests/353) by the centralized group of people who actually have the say in Monero's Community Crowdfunding System (CCS). To this day, we have never received a single penny from CCS. We sustain this project by accepting donations directly ourselves, without any middleman.
